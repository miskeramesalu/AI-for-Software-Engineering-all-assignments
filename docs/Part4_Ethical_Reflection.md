# Part 4: Ethical Reflection

In my future AI projects, I will:
- Use diverse datasets to prevent discrimination  
- Run fairness audits before deployment  
- Maintain transparency in how models make decisions  
- Document limitations and risks  
- Include humans in critical decision-making loops  

This ensures the AI remains fair, trustworthy, and centered on human values.
