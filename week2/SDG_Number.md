# Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Focus

## SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being

### Target 3.3: Fight Communicable Diseases
**By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases**

### Problem Statement
Malaria remains one of the world's most devastating infectious diseases, particularly affecting vulnerable populations in tropical regions. According to WHO:
- 247 million malaria cases worldwide in 2021
- 619,000 malaria deaths in 2021
- Disproportionately affects children under 5 and pregnant women
- Limited healthcare resources in endemic regions

### Our Contribution
This project addresses SDG 3.3 by developing an AI-powered early warning system for malaria outbreaks, enabling:
- Proactive resource allocation
- Timely intervention planning
- Data-driven public health decisions
- Reduced mortality through early detection

**Alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals:**
- Directly supports SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being)
- Indirectly supports SDG 1 (No Poverty) by reducing healthcare costs
- Supports SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) by focusing on vulnerable populations
