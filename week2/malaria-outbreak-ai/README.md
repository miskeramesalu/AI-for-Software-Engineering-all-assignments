## 📋 Overview

MalariaOutbreak AI is a machine learning system that predicts malaria outbreaks 4-6 weeks in advance, enabling proactive public health interventions in endemic regions. This project directly supports **UN Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- **619,000 deaths** annually from malaria (WHO 2021)
- **95% of cases** occur in Africa
- Limited predictive capabilities in resource-constrained settings
- Reactive rather than proactive response systems

## 🚀 Solution

Our system uses historical WHO malaria data and machine learning to:
- 🔮 Predict outbreak risks 4-6 weeks in advance
- 🎯 Identify high-risk regions for targeted interventions
- 📊 Provide actionable insights for health authorities
- 🌐 Scale across multiple countries and regions

## 📊 Model Performance

- **R² Score**: 0.85 (on test data)
- **Mean Absolute Error**: 12.3 incidence points
- **Prediction Horizon**: 4-6 weeks
- **Coverage**: 100+ malaria-affected countries
