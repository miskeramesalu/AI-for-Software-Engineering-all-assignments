# Task 1 – AI Code Generation: Theoretical Notes

Artificial Intelligence is transforming software engineering by automating code generation, refactoring, and documentation tasks. AI-powered development tools such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Tabnine can produce functional code snippets based on simple natural language prompts, enabling engineers to prototype and iterate more quickly. In this task, an AI-assisted function was generated automatically to train a machine learning model. A refined version was then manually optimized by a developer to improve readability, parameter tuning, and maintainability.

AI-generated code accelerates routine work such as creating boilerplate functions, API calls, and test cases. However, human developers remain essential to ensure correctness, scalability, and ethical compliance. The ideal approach combines AI creativity with human judgment—AI proposes, and humans validate. This hybrid workflow not only saves time but also enhances learning by allowing engineers to focus on higher-level problem-solving. Ultimately, AI code generation demonstrates the next evolution of collaborative software development, where automation complements human expertise rather than replacing it.
