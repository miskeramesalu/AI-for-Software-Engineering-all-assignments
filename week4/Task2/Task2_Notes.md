# Task 2 – AI-Enhanced Software Testing

Artificial Intelligence is transforming software testing by automatically generating test cases, detecting defects, and optimizing regression coverage. Modern AI tools analyze previous bug data and user behavior to create new tests that focus on high-risk areas. This reduces manual effort and increases test efficiency.

In this task, Selenium WebDriver is used to automate the validation of a local login page. The AI assistant proposed locators, test structure, and boundary cases such as valid and invalid credentials. Automated tests execute these scenarios without human intervention, confirming that both success and error messages appear as expected.

AI testing tools improve quality assurance by predicting where failures might occur and suggesting corrective code. However, human oversight remains vital for understanding system context and designing meaningful acceptance criteria. Combining AI automation with human reasoning results in faster, more reliable testing pipelines and lays the foundation for intelligent continuous integration systems.
