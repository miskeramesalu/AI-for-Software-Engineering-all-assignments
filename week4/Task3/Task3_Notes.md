# Task 3 – Predictive Analytics in Software Engineering

Predictive analytics leverages AI and machine learning to anticipate outcomes and guide decisions in software projects. In this task, the breast cancer dataset was used to simulate a classification problem that reflects how predictive models can identify defects, estimate delivery times, or assess risks in software systems.

Using a Random Forest algorithm, the model achieved high accuracy and reliable generalization. Hyperparameter tuning improved performance further, and a no-leakage validation confirmed robustness. Confusion matrices visualized model strengths and weaknesses across scenarios. Such interpretable metrics help engineers understand precision, recall, and overall reliability.

AI-assisted predictive modeling enables data-driven development by forecasting project quality and performance trends. However, ethical validation and explainability remain vital to ensure trustworthy use. The integration of predictive analytics into DevOps pipelines exemplifies how AI can continuously enhance quality assurance, productivity, and decision support in software engineering.
