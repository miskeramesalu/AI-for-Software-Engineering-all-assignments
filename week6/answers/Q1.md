Q1: How Edge AI reduces latency and enhances privacy compared to cloud-based AI

**Short answer (thesis):**
Edge AI runs models on devices close to the data source (phones, cameras, microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi). By processing locally, it avoids round-trips to remote servers, which reduces network latency and variability; and because raw data need not be uploaded to the cloud, data exposure is minimized — improving privacy.

**Mechanisms that reduce latency:**

* **No network round-trip:** Inference happens locally, eliminating propagation, transmission, and queueing delays inherent in cloud requests.
* **Lower jitter & greater determinism:** Edge processing is less affected by network congestion; leads to stable real-time response (critical for robotics/drones/autonomous vehicles).
* **On-device caching & pipelining:** Sensor buffers and local preprocessing avoid expensive synchronous transfers.

**Mechanisms that improve privacy:**

* **Data minimization:** Only aggregated or anonymized features are transmitted (if at all).
* **Reduced attack surface:** Fewer transmissions mean fewer opportunities for interception or cloud-side breaches; sensitive frames never leave the device.
* **Regulatory & compliance benefits:** Local processing can help meet data residency or HIPAA/GDPR-style constraints by keeping raw data on-premises.

**Trade-offs and mitigations:**

* Edge devices have limited compute, memory, and power — requiring model compression, pruning, quantization, or specialized hardware (TPU Edge, NPU).
* Versioning, updates, and fleet management become operational concerns (handled via OTA updates and containerized deployments).

**Real-world example — Autonomous drones for search & rescue:**

* **Scenario:** A drone detects humans in rubble using an on-board camera and runs a person-detection model.
* **Latency & safety:** Immediate on-board inference triggers actions (hover, send coordinates) — critical when network connectivity is absent or unreliable.
* **Privacy:** Video frames with victims do not get uploaded; only GPS + detection metadata (bounding boxes, confidence, timestamps) are sent, preserving victim privacy and reducing bandwidth.

**Conclusion:** Edge AI provides compelling latency and privacy advantages for time-critical and sensitive applications, while requiring careful model and systems engineering to fit resource constraints.
