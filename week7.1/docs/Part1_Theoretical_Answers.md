# Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

### Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples.
**Algorithmic bias** occurs when an AI system produces unfair outcomes that favor one group over another.

**Example 1:** Hiring algorithms rejecting women due to historical male-dominant datasets.  
**Example 2:** Facial recognition misidentifying darker-skinned individuals due to unbalanced training data.

### Q2: Transparency vs Explainability
**Transparency** = How the AI system is built (architecture, data source, model type).  
**Explainability** = Why the AI made a specific decision.

Both are essential to build trust and allow auditing for fairness.

### Q3: GDPR and AI Development
GDPR impacts AI by:

- Requiring **user consent**
- Enforcing **data minimization**
- Allowing users the **right to explanation**
- Restricting automated decisions that significantly affect individuals
